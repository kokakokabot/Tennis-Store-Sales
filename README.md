# Tennis Store Sales Data Generation and Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves generating a synthetic dataset for tennis equipment sales and analyzing the data using Tableau. The dataset includes sales information for different types of tennis equipment, such as rackets, balls, shoes, and apparel, over the course of two specific months (June 2022 and June 2023). Each record in the dataset contains detailed information about the sale, including product details, sale price, discount amount, customer feedback, and more.

The purpose of this dataset is to simulate a real-world scenario for a tennis equipment store to analyze sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance. This README explains how to generate the dataset and provides a link to a Tableau dashboard that visualizes the data.

## Generating the Dataset

The Python script `data_generator.py` is used to create the dataset. The script includes functions for generating random sales data according to specified rules, such as pricing strategy, sales channel, and return rates. The generated data is saved into an Excel file, `adjusted_tennis_equipment_sales.xlsx`, ready for analysis.
